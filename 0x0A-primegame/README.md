# Prime Game Module Documentation

## Overview

This module simulates a prime game between two players: Maria and Ben. The players take turns selecting numbers based on certain rules involving prime numbers. The game is played over multiple rounds, and the winner is determined based on the results of all rounds.

## Functions

### 1. `generate_primes(limit)`
This function generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

#### Parameters:
- `limit` (*int*): The upper limit (inclusive) up to which prime numbers will be generated.

#### Returns:
- *List of integers*: A list of all prime numbers less than or equal to `limit`.

#### Example Usage:
```python
primes = generate_primes(10)
print(primes)  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
```

#### Algorithm Explanation:
- The function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a classical algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.
- It initializes a boolean list `is_prime[]` where all elements are marked as `True`.
- Numbers that are not prime are then marked as `False` by iterating through the list and eliminating the multiples of each prime number.
- Finally, a list of prime numbers is returned by collecting all the indices in `is_prime[]` that are still marked as `True`.

### 2. `isWinner(x, nums)`
This function determines the winner after multiple rounds of the prime game. It tracks the scores of both Maria and Ben and decides the overall winner.

#### Parameters:
- `x` (*int*): The number of rounds to be played.
- `nums` (*List of integers*): A list where each element represents the upper limit for the numbers used in a round of the game.

#### Returns:
- *str*: The name of the winner (`"Maria"` or `"Ben"`) or `None` if the game is tied.

#### Game Rules:
1. For each round `i`:
   - The game is played using all numbers from 1 to `nums[i]`.
   - Ben automatically wins if `nums[i] == 1` (since Maria has no valid moves).
   - If `nums[i]` is a prime number, Ben wins the round.
   - Otherwise, Maria wins the round.
   
2. After all rounds, the player with the most wins is declared the overall winner. If both players have the same number of wins, the game is tied.

#### Example Usage:
```python
result = isWinner(3, [5, 1, 8])
print(result)  # Output could be 'Maria', 'Ben', or None (if tied)
```

## Detailed Walkthrough

### 1. Prime Generation (`generate_primes`):
This function is essential for the game's logic. It efficiently finds all prime numbers up to the largest number in `nums`. Prime numbers play a key role in determining the outcome of each round. The function creates an `is_prime[]` array, which indicates whether a number is prime.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a boolean list `is_prime[]` where all numbers are initially marked as prime (`True`).
2. Set `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` to `False` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
3. Iterate through numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of `limit`. For each number, mark its multiples as non-prime (`False`).
4. Return a list of numbers that are still marked as prime.

### 2. Winner Determination (`isWinner`):
This function is the core of the game logic. It simulates the game for `rounds` number of rounds and uses the prime numbers generated by `generate_primes()` to evaluate the winner of each round.

#### Steps:
1. Prime Preprocessing: The function first generates all prime numbers up to the maximum value in `nums` using the `generate_primes()` function.
2. Round-by-Round Evaluation:
   - For each round, the function checks if the number `n` is equal to 1. If it is, Ben automatically wins the round.
   - If `n` is found in the list of prime numbers, Ben also wins the round.
   - If neither condition is met, Maria wins the round.
3. Score Tracking: The function keeps track of how many rounds each player wins by incrementing the counters `scores['Maria']` and `scores['Ben']`.
4. Final Winner: After all rounds, the function compares the number of wins and returns the winner's name. If both have the same number of wins, it returns `None`.

## Example Use Case

Consider a scenario where you play 3 rounds of the game with the following numbers:
```python
rounds = 3
nums = [5, 1, 8]
```

### Round 1:
- Numbers from 1 to 5 are used.
- Primes: [2, 3, 5].
- Since 5 is a prime number, Ben wins this round.

### Round 2:
- `nums[1] = 1`, so Ben wins automatically because Maria has no moves.

### Round 3:
- Numbers from 1 to 8 are used.
- Primes: [2, 3, 5, 7].
- Since 8 is not a prime number, Maria wins this round.

Final result: Ben wins 2 rounds, Maria wins 1 round. The function would return `"Ben"`.

---

## Edge Cases

1. No Rounds (`rounds = 0`):
   - The function will return `None` as no game is played.
   
2. Single Element `nums` with Value 1:
   - If `nums = [1]`, Ben wins by default since Maria cannot move.

3. Prime-Dominant Rounds:
   - If most numbers in `nums` are prime numbers, Ben will likely dominate the game as he wins whenever the number is prime.

## Time Complexity

### `generate_primes(limit)`:
- The time complexity is `O(n log log n)`, where `n` is the value of `limit`, due to the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

### `isWinner(rounds, nums)`:
- The time complexity is `O(n log log n + x)` where:
  - `n` is the maximum value in `nums` for prime generation.
  - `x` is the number of rounds, as we loop through each round and check if the number is in the prime list.
